# Resturant

This project aims to create a simulation of a resturant order process, creating customers, assigning them order requirements, orders being made and payment made,
and end of day profits.


The must haves of this project are:
- A menu list with unique products and prices.
- The menu must change based on AM vs PM
- Customers must have random orders based on the menu list.
- Multiple tills must be used by different customers.
- There must be a transaction record associated with each customer and include items ordered, time ordered and total price paid.
- The full transaction history must be displayed at the end of the day.
- At the end of the day the tills must be tallied up to make a profit total and show how many customers attended.

Additional goals (if there's time)
- Add a timer for the customer order process to be updates e.g. customers take 1 second to order and pay then the next customer can order.
